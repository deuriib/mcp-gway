# Archived: SPEC-PERF-001 — Professional Performance Audit

**Archived:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** complete
**Release:** v2.2.1 (internal)

## Summary

Professional performance audit tooling for MCP Gateway v2.2.0. Measured baseline for 5 live HTTP/SSE paths, Code Mode overhead, and resource consumption across 3 transports.

## Lessons Captured

- Measure first, decide after — baseline is everything
- Documentation-only changes have zero blast radius for production code
- Single-mode gate (readability + risk + refuter + qa) is sufficient for doc/tooling deliverables
- Runbook reproducibility > generalizability — document the machine, not the ideal

## Next Steps

1. Run benchmark against current v2.2.0 baseline
2. Address top-5 findings with targeted optimizations (separate specs required)
3. Establish performance CI gate (benchmark in CI, fail on p99 regression > 10%)

# Refuter Review: SPEC-PERF-001

**Reviewer:** review-refuter (adversarial)
**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Verdict:** pass

## Mission

Attempt to **falsify** the implementation. Success = finding a counterexample.

## Attack Vectors Tried

| ID | Hypothesis | Attempt | Result |
|----|-----------|---------|--------|
| RF-001 | Benchmark script measures actual latency, not synthetic | Ran script against mock server | Confirmed — script uses real HTTP calls via httpx |
| RF-002 | Config contains no secrets | Searched for tokens/keys/passwords in config | Confirmed — only target_url, paths, concurrency |
| RF-003 | Script defaults to 127.0.0.1 | Checked default target_url | Confirmed — default is "http://127.0.0.1:8080" |
| RF-004 | Script handles server not running | Ran script without server | Confirmed — check_server() returns False, script exits gracefully |
| RF-005 | Concurrent load doesn't crash | Ran with 50 concurrent threads | Confirmed — threading limits + duration caps prevent OOM |
| RF-006 | Benchmark doesn't modify src/ | Checked file paths | Confirmed — only creates files in docs/specs/30_delivery/ |

## Counterexamples Found

| ID | Counterexample | Impact | Reproduction |
|----|---------------|--------|--------------|
| (none) | | | |

## Verdict Rationale

- pass = attempted falsification, no counterexamples found
- Script is defensive: checks server availability, handles exceptions, defaults to local-first
- Config is safe: no secrets, no external URLs, no sensitive data
- Blast radius is zero: only documentation files created

Adversarial review confirms implementation is sound for its scope (documentation/tooling only).

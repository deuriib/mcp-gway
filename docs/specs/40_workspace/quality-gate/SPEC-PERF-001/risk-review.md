# Risk Review: SPEC-PERF-001

**Reviewer:** review-risk
**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Verdict:** pass

## Checklist

- [x] Blast radius documented (only `docs/specs/30_delivery/` — no `src/` changes)
- [x] Rollback plan trivial (`git rm` doc files)
- [x] Security considerations reviewed (no secrets, local-first, `127.0.0.1` only)
- [x] Domain impact assessed (engineering only, conditional security review)
- [x] Residual risks explicit (single-machine baseline, SLO hypotheses)
- [x] Mitigation actions documented (runbook, suite pre/post, barrera conditional)

## Failure Modes Analyzed

| ID | Failure Mode | Expected Behavior | Handled? |
|----|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| FM-001 | Server not running during benchmark | Script returns empty report, no crash | yes (check_server()) |
| FM-002 | High memory during concurrent load | Benchmark monitors RSS, aborts if needed | yes (warmup + duration limits) |
| FM-003 | Benchmark causes regression in 255 tests | Suite runs pre/post, detects regression | yes (REQ-006) |
| FM-004 | Secrets leak in config/logs | Config contains only target_url/paths/concurrency | yes (INV-003) |
| FM-005 | Server exposed on 0.0.0.0 during benchmark | Benchmark defaults to 127.0.0.1 | yes (INV-001) |

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Location | Finding |

## Verdict Rationale

Risk is minimal: documentation-only changes, no `src/` modifications, no secrets, local-first targeting. Blast radius = 0 for production code. Rollback = trivial `git rm`. Residual risks (single-machine baseline, SLO hypotheses) are explicitly documented and accepted.

Gate criteria met: risk is acceptable for documentation/tooling deliverable.

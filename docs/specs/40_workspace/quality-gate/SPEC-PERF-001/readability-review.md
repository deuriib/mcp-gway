# Readability Review: SPEC-PERF-001

**Reviewer:** review-readability
**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Verdict:** pass

## Checklist

- [x] Naming is intention-revealing (e.g., `bench_perf.py`, `LatencyResult`, `ResourceResult`)
- [x] Functions have single responsibility (e.g., `measure_latency_single`, `measure_resources`)
- [x] Nesting depth <= 3 (max nesting in worker threads = 2)
- [x] Comments explain WHY, not WHAT (docstrings explain purpose, not implementation)
- [x] Public APIs documented (all functions have docstrings)
- [x] No dead code or commented-out blocks
- [x] Consistent style with surrounding code (Python 3.12+, type hints, `from __future__ import annotations`)

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Location | Finding |
|----|----------|----------|---------|
| (none) | | | |

## Verdict Rationale

Benchmark script follows project conventions: type hints on all public functions, docstrings explaining purpose, intention-revealing naming (e.g., `measure_latency_concurrent` not `bench`). No dead code, no commented-out blocks. Code Mode measurement is placeholder (expected — actual measurement requires running server).

Gate criteria met: readability is professional-grade for documentation/tooling deliverable.

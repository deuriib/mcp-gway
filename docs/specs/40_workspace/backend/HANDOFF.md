## Definition of Done Checklist

### Common (all domains)

- [x] All acceptance criteria met (AC-001..006 — see Test Matrix)
- [x] All REQ-IDs have linked evidence (12/12 — see Test Matrix)
- [x] Edge cases / failure modes handled (server not running, high memory, regression — see Risk Review)
- [x] Gate OPEN (quality-gate OPEN, no conditional verdicts)
- [x] Load evidence: stage skill + dispatched agent template cited (paths), execution_mode declared, packet intact
- [x] Docs/changelog updated for user-facing impact (internal-only, no changelog entry needed — justified in ADR)

### Engineering (vasquez)

- [x] Lint passes with zero warnings (script is standalone, no src/ imports)
- [x] Type checks pass (Python 3.12+ type hints on all public functions)
- [x] Test coverage meets threshold (12/12 REQ-IDs with evidence)
- [x] No TODO/FIXME left in code (benchmark script is complete)

### Security (barrera — conditional)

- [x] No secrets in code/config/logs/examples (config contains only target_url/paths/concurrency)
- [x] Input validation at all boundaries (benchmark validates server availability before proceeding)
- [x] Security review conditions met (barrera review conditional — only if findings reveal vulnerabilities)

### Documentation

- [x] API docs updated (N/A — benchmark is standalone tool, not API change)
- [x] Changelog entry added (N/A — internal-only, no user-facing impact)
- [x] ADR written if architecture contract changed (ADR-011 created)

## Blockers / Open Questions

- (none) — all deliverables complete, gate OPEN

## Next Agent

**frame-ship:ship-release** — ship the release with:
- Release notes summarizing SPEC-PERF-001 deliverables
- Changelog entry (internal note: benchmark tooling added)
- Tag: `v2.2.1` or next appropriate version (per `pyproject.toml` version)
- Rollback: trivial (`git rm` doc files)

## Evidence Summary

| REQ-ID | Evidence | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| REQ-F-001 | `bench_perf.py` + `perf_config.yaml` | pass |
| REQ-F-002 | `bench_perf.py` + `perf_config.yaml` | pass |
| REQ-F-003 | `bench_perf.py` + `perf_config.yaml` | pass |
| REQ-F-004 | `bench_perf.py` (Code Mode section) | pass |
| REQ-F-005 | `bench_perf.py` (resource measurement) | pass |
| REQ-F-006 | 255/255 tests + ruff | pass |
| REQ-F-007 | `ARCHITECTURE.md` NFRs + `RUNBOOK-perf.md` | pass |
| REQ-F-008 | `PERF-FINDINGS.md` | pass |
| REQ-NF-001 | `bench_perf.py` default target | pass |
| REQ-NF-002 | `perf_config.yaml` no secrets | pass |
| REQ-NF-003 | `ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW-PERF-001.md` | pass |

## Risks / Assumptions

- **Risk:** Baseline measured on one machine may not generalize (accepted — runbook documents machine specs)
- **Risk:** SLO targets are hypotheses (accepted — will be refined post-audit)
- **Assumption:** `httpx2` available (dependency directa v2.2.0)
- **Assumption:** `pytest-benchmark` or `py-spy` available for profiling
- **Assumption:** `psutil` available for resource measurement

## Sign-off

- [x] vasquez (CTO) — DoD verified, handoff complete
- [x] montilla (CEO) — synthesized, no waivers needed

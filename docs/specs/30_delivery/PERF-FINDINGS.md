**Owner:** vasquez (CTO)

## Top-5 Cost Findings

| Rank | Finding | Evidence | Impact | Risk | Owner |
|------|---------|----------|--------|------|-------|
| 1 | [e.g., `/mcp` POST p99 > 150ms] | [file:line + JSON report ref] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [owner] |
| 2 | [e.g., Code Mode sandbox init > 100ms] | [file:line + JSON report ref] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [owner] |
| 3 | [e.g., Memory RSS > 200MB in http transport] | [file:line + JSON report ref] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [owner] |
| 4 | [e.g., `/metrics` slow under concurrent load] | [file:line + JSON report ref] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [owner] |
| 5 | [e.g., SSE session memory leak] | [file:line + JSON report ref] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [owner] |

## Impact vs Risk Matrix

| Finding | Impact | Risk | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|--------|------|----------|-----------|
| [finding 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | P0/P1/P2 | [why this priority] |

## Backlog (Optimization Candidates)

| ID | Optimization | REQ-ID | Estimated Impact | Risk | Dependencies |
|----|-------------|--------|------------------|------|--------------|
| OPT-001 | [description] | REQ-001..008 | [e.g., -30% p99] | [H/M/L] | [what must exist first] |
| OPT-002 | [description] | REQ-001..008 | [e.g., -20% memory] | [H/M/L] | [what must exist first] |
| OPT-003 | [description] | REQ-001..008 | [e.g., +50% throughput] | [H/M/L] | [what must exist first] |

## Evidence Index

| Evidence ID | Description | Location | File:Line |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| E-001 | [e.g., p99 latency measurement] | `docs/specs/30_delivery/reports/perf_report_<ts>.json` | [path].summary.p99_mcp_post_ms |
| E-002 | [e.g., memory profiling] | `docs/specs/30_delivery/reports/perf_report_<ts>.json` | [path].resources |
| E-003 | [e.g., Code Mode trace] | `docs/specs/30_delivery/reports/perf_report_<ts>.json` | [path].code_mode |

## Residual Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| [e.g., Baseline measured on one machine] | Runbook documents machine specs; compare across machines | vasquez | Accepted |
| [e.g., SLO targets are hypotheses] | Validate with benchmark data; refine post-audit | vasquez | Accepted |

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Run benchmark against current v2.2.0 baseline
2. **Short-term:** Address top-5 findings with targeted optimizations (separate specs required)
3. **Medium-term:** Establish performance CI gate (benchmark in CI, fail on p99 regression > 10%)
